- âœ… Test framework integration - models discoverable and executable

**USER REQUEST FULFILLED:**
> "OK, let's work on adding them all. I do indeed expect a bunch of them to fail, and those are the most important models for me, we need to analyze the failure models and then we know how to improve the algo."

**CURRENT STATUS:**
- Implementation: âœ… COMPLETE
- Build Integration: âœ… COMPLETE  
- Test Framework Addition: âœ… COMPLETE

**NEXT SCIENTIFIC STEPS:**

2. **Pattern Identification**: Categorize failure modes (identifiability issues, numerical conditioning, solver limitations)
3. **Algorithm Improvement**: Use failure data to enhance identifiability analysis, numerical stability, or solver integration
4. **Iterative Testing**: Re-test improved algorithms against challenging model set

**Algorithm Implementation Goal:** Implement a novel parameter estimation algorithm for polynomial ODE systems using the existing `IdentifiabilityAnalyzer`, `AAAApprox`, `Polynomial`/`RationalFunction` classes, polynomial system solving (e.g., PHC, MSolve), and ODE integration.

**References:**
*   `identifiability_analyzer.hpp`: Provides structural identifiability analysis and required derivative orders.
*   `aa_approximator.hpp`: Provides AAA rational approximator for observables.
*   `polynomial.hpp`: Defines `Variable`, `Monomial`, `Polynomial`, `RationalFunction` classes and operations.
*   `observed_ode_system.hpp`: Defines the structure for the ODE system and observables.
*   Polynomial Solvers (e.g., `PHCSolver`, `MSolveSolver`): Used for solving the algebraic polynomial system.
*   `boost::odeint`: Used for forward/backward ODE integration.

**Required Inputs:**

*   [x] **`ObservedOdeSystem`:** An object containing:
    *   Polynomial ODE system: \\( \\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x, p) \\) using `Polynomial<double>`.
    *   Observable definitions: \\( y = h(x, p) \\) using `Polynomial<double>`.
    *   State variables (`std::vector<Variable>`).
    *   Parameters (`std::vector<Variable>`).
    *   Observables (`std::vector<Observable>`).
*   [x] **Data:** Time series data for the observables \\( y_k(t_i) \\) for observable \\( k \\) at time points \\( t_i \\).
*   [x] **`parameters_to_analyze`:** `std::vector<Variable>` specifying which parameters and/or initial conditions to estimate.
*   [x] **`max_derivative_order_config`:** An integer specifying the maximum derivative order the `IdentifiabilityAnalyzer` should consider.
    *   **Note:** While `AAApproximator` might support up to 10th order (compile-time), practical estimation from noisy data usually limits this to 3-5. For structural analysis in `IdentifiabilityAnalyzer`, a higher value (e.g., up to 10) can be used if the system complexity demands it, assuming the approximator can provide values.

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Identifiability Analysis (Using `IdentifiabilityAnalyzer`)**
    *   [x] Instantiate `IdentifiabilityAnalyzer`.
    *   [x] Run `analyzer.analyze(...)` to get `AnalysisResults`.
    *   [x] **Extract Results:**
        *   [x] `identifiable_parameters`
        *   [x] `non_identifiable_parameters`
        *   [x] `results.required_derivative_orders` (minimal orders from SVD analysis)
        *   [x] `results.square_system_derivative_orders` (orders determined by `determine_square_system_orders`, aiming for a structurally complete algebraic system). This is used by `setup_estimation`.
    *   [x] **Symbolic Derivative Computation Strategy:**
        *   [x] `internal::compute_required_symbolic_derivatives` (in `parameter_estimator.cpp`) computes symbolic `RationalFunction<double>` for:
            *   State derivatives \\( \\frac{d^j x_i}{dt^j} = \\text{Expr}_x(x, x', ..., p) \\) (less-substituted form).
            *   Observable derivatives \\( \\frac{d^l y_k}{dt^l} = \\text{Expr}_y(x, x', ..., p) \\) (less-substituted form).
        *   [x] This less-substituted approach is preferred to avoid monomial explosion and allow solvers to handle intermediate derivatives as explicit variables.

2.  **Observable Approximation (Using `AAApproximator`)**
    *   [x] Instantiate `AAApproximator` for each observable.
    *   [x] Fit to time series data.
    *   [x] **Select Evaluation Time(s) \\( t_{eval} \\).**
    *   [x] **Compute Approximated Derivatives:** For each observable \\( y_k \\) and order \\( l \\) (up to the order specified by `setup_data.required_derivative_orders`), compute \\( \\hat{y}_k^{(l)}(t_{eval}) \\).
    *   [x] `AAApproximator` uses Boost.Autodiff for derivatives, with a current internal compile-time cap (`FixedCompileTimeOrder = 10`).

3.  **Polynomial System Construction at \\( t_{eval} \\) (Less Substitution Approach)**
    *   [x] Implemented in `ParameterEstimator::build_algebraic_system_internal`.
    *   [x] **Define Algebraic Unknowns:** Dynamically determined based on variables appearing in observable equations and the definitions of necessary state derivatives. Includes:
        *   Identifiable Parameters: \\( p_{id} \\)
        *   Base States at \\(t_{eval}\\): \\( x_i(t_{eval}) \\) (represented as `Variable(name, 0)`)
        *   Necessary State Derivatives at \\(t_{eval}\\): \\( \\frac{d^j x_i}{dt^j}(t_{eval}) \\) (represented as `Variable(name, j)`)
    *   [x] **Construct Polynomial Equations:**
        *   [x] **Observable Equations:** `SymbolicExpr(y_k^(l)) - hat_y_k^(l)(t_eval) = 0`. The `SymbolicExpr` is the less-substituted form.
        *   [x] **State Derivative Definition Equations:** `Variable(x_i, j) - SymbolicExpr_RHS(d^j x_i / dt^j) = 0`.
    *   [x] **Substitute Known Values:** Fixed values for `non_identifiable_parameters` are substituted into the symbolic expressions.
    *   [x] **Result:** A system of polynomial equations where intermediate derivatives are explicit unknowns. The goal is for this system to be square. Current tests show this results in a square system for the `PHCSolver`.

4.  **Polynomial System Solving (e.g., `PHCSolver`)**
    *   [x] `ParameterEstimator::solve` calls the `PolynomialSolver` interface.
    *   [x] `PHCSolver` implementation is used for current tests.
    *   [x] Extracts numerical solutions for all unknowns (parameters, states, state derivatives at \\(t_{eval}\\)).

5.  **Backward ODE Integration**
    *   [x] For each real solution from Step 4:
        *   [x] Extract state values \\( x(t_{eval}) \\).
        *   [x] Form full parameter set \\( p \\).
        *   [x] Integrate ODE backward from \\( t_{eval} \\) to \\( t_{initial} \\) to find \\( x(t_{initial}) \\).
    *   [x] Implemented in `ParameterEstimator::process_solutions_and_validate`.

6.  **Forward Simulation and Validation**
    *   [x] For each candidate \\( (x(t_{initial}), p) \\) from Step 5:
        *   [x] Integrate ODE forward from \\( t_{initial} \\) to \\( t_{final} \\).
        *   [x] Calculate predicted observables \\( y_{pred, k}(t_i) \\).
        *   [x] Compute error metric (RMSE).
        *   [x] Filter results based on threshold.
    *   [x] Implemented in `ParameterEstimator::process_solutions_and_validate`.

**Sub-Project: `MSolveSolver` Enhancement for Complex Solutions via Rational Parametrization (Current Focus)**

**Overall Goal:** Modify `MSolveSolver` to use `msolve`'s rational parametrization feature (`-P 2` flag) to obtain all complex solutions of a polynomial system. This involves parsing a new JSON output (generated by `scripts/msolve_p_to_json.py`), solving a univariate polynomial for its complex roots using `FLINT/ARBLIB`, and then reconstructing the full multivariate solutions.

**Motivation:** The previous `MSolveSolver` integration primarily targeted real solutions. The new approach is needed to obtain all complex solutions, which are often required for downstream tasks or for systems where real solutions are insufficient or non-existent.

**Progress & Completed Steps:**

1.  **Univariate Root Finding Module (`UnivariateSolverFlint`) - COMPLETE**
    *   [x] Created `include/univariate_solver_flint.hpp` and `src/univariate_solver_flint.cpp`.
    *   [x] Implemented `find_roots` function taking string coefficients (integer, fraction "num/den", decimal) and precision.
    *   [x] Uses `FLINT/ARBLIB`'s `acb_poly_find_roots` internally.
    *   [x] Converts `arb_t` coefficients and `acb_t` roots to/from standard C++ types (`std::string`, `std::complex<double>`).
    *   [x] Comprehensive unit tests (`tests/univariate_solver_flint_test.cpp`) written and **ALL PASSING**.
        *   Covers various polynomial types, fractional/decimal coefficients, edge cases, and residual checks.

2.  **Build System Integration for FLINT - COMPLETE**
    *   [x] Added `flint` as a dependency in `vcpkg.json` (manifest mode).
    *   [x] Updated `CMakeLists.txt` to correctly find and link against the vcpkg-provided FLINT.
    *   [x] Resolved complex GMP/FLINT compilation conflicts related to C++ stream operators and header include order/guards.

3.  **`msolve` Command and Python Script Pipeline - Functioning**
    *   [x] `MSolveSolver::solve()` in `src/MSolveSolver.cpp` modified to correctly call the `msolve` executable with the `-P 2` flag to output rational parametrization data.
    *   [x] Python script `scripts/msolve_p_to_json.py` updated to:
        *   Parse the `msolve -P 2` output format (using Lark).
        *   **Only** print the resulting JSON data to `stdout` (informational messages go to `stderr` or are conditional).
        *   Handle some basic non-list error outputs from `msolve` by trying to convert them to a simple JSON structure.
    *   [x] `MSolveSolver::solve()` updated to:
        *   Correctly locate and execute the new `scripts/msolve_p_to_json.py` script (robust path finding).
        *   Successfully capture the JSON string output from the Python script.
        *   Successfully parse this JSON string into a `nlohmann::json parsed_json` object.
        *   Currently prints the captured and parsed JSON for debugging, then clears solutions (returns empty set).

**Current Phase: MS-2: JSON Parsing and Component Extraction (IN PROGRESS)**

*   **Location:** Inside `MSolveSolver::solve()`, within the `try` block after `nlohmann::json parsed_json = nlohmann::json::parse(json_output_str);`.
*   **Objective:** Extract the necessary components of the rational parametrization from `parsed_json`.
*   **Current Micro-Task (In the middle of implementing):** Interpreting the `parsed_json` object based on the structure documented in `msolve-tutorial.tex` (Section 7) and seen in `inspo/outputs/four_variables.json`.
    *   The expected top-level JSON structure is an array: `[<dim_flag>, <data_if_dim_zero_or_param>]`.

**Immediate Next Micro-Steps within `MSolveSolver::solve()`:**

1.  **Check Solution Type from JSON:**
    *   [ ] Access `parsed_json[0]` to get the dimension flag (e.g., `0` for finite solutions, `-1` for no solutions, `1` for positive dimension).
    *   [ ] **Action:** If `dim_flag` is not `0`, throw a `std::runtime_error` or print an error and return an empty `PolynomialSolutionSet` (per user request to defer handling non-zero-dim cases).

2.  **If `dim_flag == 0`, proceed to extract parametrization components from `parsed_json[1]`:**
    *   The structure of `parsed_json[1]` is `[<characteristic>, <num_vars_in_param_rep>, <degree_system>, <vars_list>, <linear_form_coeffs>, <parametrization_data>]`.
    *   **Extract Variable Names:**
        *   [ ] Access `vars_list` (e.g., `parsed_json[1][3]`). This is a JSON array of strings.
        *   [ ] Convert to `std::vector<std::string> stored_poly_vars;`.
        *   [ ] (For Debugging) Print `stored_poly_vars`.
    *   **Extract Eliminating Polynomial `w(t)` (lw):**
        *   [ ] `parametrization_data` is `parsed_json[1][5]`. `lw` is at `parametrization_data[1][0]`. This is `[degree, [coeffs_list]]`.
        *   [ ] Extract `coeffs_list` for `w(t)`. These are JSON numbers.
        *   [ ] Convert to `std::vector<std::string> w_coeffs_str;` (for `UnivariateSolverFlint::find_roots`).
        *   [ ] (For Debugging) Print `w_coeffs_str`.
    *   **Extract Derivative Polynomial `w'(t)` (lwp):**
        *   [ ] `lwp` is at `parametrization_data[1][1]`. This is `[degree, [coeffs_list]]`.
        *   [ ] Extract `coeffs_list` for `w'(t)`.
        *   [ ] Convert to `std::vector<std::string> wp_coeffs_str;`.
        *   [ ] (For Debugging) Print `wp_coeffs_str`.

3.  **(After above is verified) Extract Parametrizing Polynomials `v_i(t)`:**
    *   [ ] `params_list` for `v_i(t)` is at `parametrization_data[1][2]`. This is a JSON array.
    *   [ ] Each element corresponds to an original variable (from `stored_poly_vars`, excluding the actual parametrization variable name if it was one of them, or matching by order if a new variable like 'A' was introduced by msolve).
    *   [ ] Each `v_i` element is `[[deg_vi, [coeffs_vi_list]], denominator_ci_int]`.
    *   [ ] For each `v_i`: Store `coeffs_vi_list` (as `std::vector<std::string>`) and `denominator_ci_int`.
    *   [ ] This will likely result in a `std::vector` of structures/pairs, each holding the coefficient strings and denominator for a `v_i(t)`.

**Future Phases (Post MS-2):**

*   **Phase MS-3: Univariate Solving and Solution Reconstruction**
    *   [ ] Call `univariate_solver::find_roots(w_coeffs_str, precision)` to get roots `Î¸_j` of `w(t)=0`.
    *   [ ] For each root `Î¸_j`:
        *   [ ] Evaluate `w'(Î¸_j)` using `wp_coeffs_str` and `Î¸_j` (requires polynomial evaluation at a complex point).
        *   [ ] For each `v_i(t)`:
            *   [ ] Evaluate `v_i(Î¸_j)` using its coefficients and `Î¸_j`.
            *   [ ] Remember to divide by its `denominator_ci`.
            *   [ ] Calculate solution component `x_k = -v_i(Î¸_j) / w'(Î¸_j)`.
        *   [ ] Assemble `PolynomialSolutionMap` and add to `PolynomialSolutionSet`.
*   **Phase MS-4: Integration and Testing**
    *   [ ] Test `MSolveSolver` with systems having known complex solutions.
    *   [ ] Ensure correct `std::complex<double>` results and variable mapping.
    *   [ ] Update existing tests (e.g., `MSolveSolverDirectTest`, `ParameterEstimatorIntegrationTest`) to expect complex solutions and verify them if they now use the enhanced `MSolveSolver`.

### Phase MS-2: JSON Parsing and Component Extraction (COMPLETED - Iterated)

- **Tasks:**
    - âœ… Develop Python script (`msolve_p_to_json.py`) to parse `msolve -P 2` output (rational parametrization for 0-D systems) into a structured JSON.
        - âœ… Extract dimension flag.
        - âœ… Extract variable list (`vars_list`).
        - âœ… Extract eliminating polynomial `w(t)` coefficients (`lw_struct`).
        - âœ… Extract derivative `w'(t)` coefficients (`lwp_struct`).
        - âœ… Extract parametrizing rational functions `v_k(t) = N_k(t)/D_k` (`params_list_struct`).
    - âœ… Update `MSolveSolver::solve()` in C++:
        - âœ… Call the Python script on `msolve`'s raw output file.
        - âœ… Parse the resulting JSON using `nlohmann/json`.
        - âœ… Extract all necessary components identified above.
    - âœ… Implement helper in C++ to evaluate a polynomial (string coefficients) at a complex point.
    - âœ… Implement root finding for `w(t)` (e.g., using `univariate_solver_flint`).
    - âœ… Implement solution reconstruction: For each root `theta_j` of `w(t)`, calculate `x_k = v_k(theta_j) / w'(theta_j)`.

- **Learnings & Notes (Major Iterations & Discoveries):**
    - Initial parsing of `msolve` output based on `-P 2` flag and tutorial examples.
    - Identified indexing issues for `lw`, `lwp`, `params_list_struct` within the nested JSON from msolve. Corrected based on `msolve-tutorial.tex` and test output.
    - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY 1:** `msolve` (the version `/usr/bin/msolve`) behaves differently with floating-point coefficient inputs versus exact rational fraction inputs.
        - With float inputs (e.g., `-6.06531`), even with `-P 2`, `msolve` produced an *incorrect* rational parametrization leading to wrong final solutions (e.g., `p=-1, x=-1` instead of `p=0.5, x=6.06...` for the `SingleStateOneParam` test after correction, or `p=1,x=1` initially).
    - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY 2:** When providing msolve with **exact fractional input** (e.g., `-606531/100000+x`) AND using the `-P 2` flag:
        - `msolve` produces a *different* and *more structured* rational parametrization.
        - The C++ reconstruction formula `X_k = v_k(theta_j) / w'(theta_j)` (where `v_k(t_j) = N_k(t_j)/D_k`) derived from the msolve output JSON then yields values that are correct *up to a sign* for some variables.
        - For `SingleStateOneParam` (target `p=-0.5, x=6.06..`), the reconstruction from msolve's fractional output yielded `p=0.5, x=-6.06..`.
    - **EMPIRICAL FIX for 0-D with -P 2 & Fractional Input:** Negating the `v_k(theta_j)` term (i.e., `-(N_k(theta_j)/D_k)`) in the C++ reconstruction formula resulted in correct solutions for `SingleStateOneParam`. This implies a sign convention in msolve's `-P 2` output for `params_list_struct` components when the `P_` flag (OuterP_data[0]) is `1`.

### Phase MS-3: Univariate Solving and Solution Reconstruction (COMPLETED - Iterated with `MS-2`)

- **Tasks:** (Mostly covered and iterated within MS-2 due to parsing discoveries)
    - âœ… Integrate `univariate_solver_flint::find_roots` for `w(t)`.
    - âœ… Implement the loop for each root `theta_j`.
    - âœ… Evaluate `w'(theta_j)`. Handle division by zero.
    - âœ… Evaluate each `v_k(theta_j)`.
    - âœ… Apply reconstruction formula: `x_k = v_k(theta_j) / w'(theta_j)`.
        - âœ… **Applied empirical negation to `v_k(theta_j)` term for 0-D systems when input is fractional and using `-P 2`.**
    - âœ… Map reconstructed msolve variable values back to original `system.unknowns` using `var_to_msolve_name_map`.
    - âœ… Populate `PolynomialSolutionSet`.

- **Learnings & Notes:**
    - Debugging of namespaces for helper functions (`poly_ode::evaluate_poly_at_complex`, `poly_ode::univariate_solver::find_roots`).
    - Clarified `PolynomialSolutionMap` key type to be `poly_ode::Variable` instead of `std::string` to correctly differentiate between variables and their derivatives in the context of `ParameterEstimator`.
    - The `var_to_msolve_name_map` became crucial for robustly mapping msolve's string variable names back to the `poly_ode::Variable` objects.
    - Distinct naming for derivative variables (e.g., `d1x`) for msolve input was tested and confirmed msolve still produced the same (incorrect for floats, different-but-systematically-signed for fractions) output, confirming the issue was with msolve's processing or output interpretation, not just name collision.

### Phase MS-4: Integration with Parameter Estimator & Advanced Testing (IN PROGRESS)

- **Tasks:**
    - âœ… Switch `ParameterEstimator` tests (`SolveSimpleSystemWithMSolve`, `MultiTevalTest`, `ScenariosTest`) to use `MSolveSolver` instead of `PHCSolver` or `CeresSolver`.
    - âœ… Ensure `MSolveSolver` correctly populates `PolynomialSolutionMap` with `Variable` keys.
    - âœ… **Implement robust `double` to exact fraction string conversion for `MSolveSolver` input.** (Using Flint `fmpq_set_d`, `fmpq_get_str`).
    - Review and standardize ODE integration settings (tolerances, `dt_hint`, fixed vs. adaptive) in `ParameterEstimator::process_solutions_and_validate`.
    - Remove extensive debug logging from `MSolveSolver` and `ODESystem` once stable.
    - **Address 1-Dimensional System Output:** (`ParameterEstimatorScenariosTest.SumTestSystem` failure)
        - Modify `MSolveSolver::solve()` to correctly parse `msolve` output when `dim_flag = 1`.
        - The Python script might need to be adapted if the JSON structure for 1-D systems is different or if it needs to output symbolic parameters.
        - `MSolveSolver` needs to return solutions that can represent free parameters (e.g., update `PolynomialSolutionSet` or use a new return type).
        - `ParameterEstimator` needs to be able to consume these parametric solutions.
    - Add more comprehensive direct tests for `MSolveSolver` covering various system types (if msolve can handle them reliably).
    - Investigate and confirm the sign convention for `v_k(t)` from msolve's `-P 2` output more formally if possible.

- **Current Status (Post-Intensive Debugging):**
    - `MSolveSolver` now successfully solves 0-dimensional systems that `ParameterEstimator` generates when:
        1. Input coefficients to `msolve` are converted to exact fractions.
        2. The `v_k(theta_j)` term in the C++ reconstruction formula is empirically negated.
    - Most tests involving `MSolveSolver` for 0-D scenarios are passing.
    - `SumTestSystem` fails as expected because `msolve` reports it as 1-dimensional, which our solver doesn't yet handle.

- **Open Questions/Risks:**
    - Long-term reliability of `msolve` on the target system, especially its handling of floating-point inputs or its internal numerical stability for more complex systems.
    - The exact, documented specification for `msolve`'s `-P 2` output format, especially concerning signs and the `linear_form_coeffs`.
    - Scalability of the current Python script bridge for very large outputs (though less of a concern now that direct solution parsing for 0-D is not via `-P 2` if we chose that path, but we're sticking to `-P 2` for now).
