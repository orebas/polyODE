# Session Notes - January 2025: Challenging Model Implementation

## Session Objective
Implement all remaining challenging models from Julia codebase for scientific failure analysis of the parameter estimation algorithm, as explicitly requested by the user.

## User Request
> "OK, let's work on adding them all. I do indeed expect a bunch of them to fail, and those are the most important models for me, we need to analyze the failure models and then we know how to improve the algo."

## Completed Work

### 1. Model Implementation (13 new models)
**Files Modified:**
- `/home/orebas/cpp/polyODE/tests/model_registrations.cpp` - Added 13 new model registration functions
- `/home/orebas/cpp/polyODE/tests/model_registrations.hpp` - Added function declarations

**Models Implemented:**
1. `biohydrogenation` - Complex reaction network (9 parameters, 5 states, 5 observables)
2. `repressilator` - Genetic oscillator with Hill functions (7 parameters, 6 states, 3 observables, rational functions)
3. `hiv_old_wrong` - Intentionally incorrect HIV dynamics (10 parameters, 5 states, 4 observables)
4. `daisy_mamil3` - 3-compartment pharmacokinetic (5 parameters, 3 states, 2 observables)
5. `daisy_mamil4` - 4-compartment pharmacokinetic (7 parameters, 4 states, 3 observables)
6. `lv_periodic` - Periodic Lotka-Volterra (4 parameters, 2 states, 2 observables)
7. `slowfast` - Multi-timescale dynamics (3 parameters, 6 states, 4 observables)
8. `sirsforced` - Forced SIRS epidemiological (6 parameters, 5 states, 2 observables)
9. `allee_competition` - Population dynamics with Allee effect (8 parameters, 2 states, 2 observables, rational functions)
10. `two_compartment_pk` - Pharmacokinetics with volume scaling (5 parameters, 2 states, 1 observable, rational functions)
11. `crauste` - Immune cell dynamics "wrong" version (13 parameters, 5 states, 4 observables)
12. `crauste_corrected` - Immune cell dynamics corrected (13 parameters, 5 states, 4 observables)
13. `crauste_revised` - Immune cell dynamics extended (16 parameters, 5 states, 4 observables)

### 2. Test Framework Integration
**File Modified:**
- `/home/orebas/cpp/polyODE/tests/systematic_model_tests.cpp` - Added 13 new `TEST_F` functions

**Test Configuration:**
- All models configured for failure analysis with `strict_identifiability_checking = false`
- `expected_identifiable_count = -1` to allow scientific analysis without preset expectations
- Relaxed tolerances (`parameter_tolerance = 1e-1`, `ic_tolerance = 1e-1`)
- Explicit handling for expected failures with informative messages

### 3. Scientific Methodology
**Approach:**
- Models specifically chosen for their challenging characteristics:
  - High parameter counts (up to 16 parameters)
  - Rational functions in ODEs
  - Multi-scale dynamics
  - Complex biological/pharmacological systems
  - Intentionally incorrect dynamics for baseline failure analysis

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Many models expected to fail for various reasons:
  - Identifiability issues
  - Numerical conditioning problems
  - Solver limitations with high-dimensional systems
  - Complex rational function dynamics

## Technical Details

### Build Integration
- All models compile successfully
- CMake integration verified
- Test framework properly discovers all new models
- Model registry system handles the expanded model set

### Implementation Quality
- Proper parameter/state variable management
- Correct observable definitions
- Appropriate metadata for systematic analysis
- Consistent naming conventions and documentation

## Current Status
- **Implementation: COMPLETE** ✅
- **Build Integration: COMPLETE** ✅
- **Test Framework Addition: COMPLETE** ✅
- **Currently Running:** Full test suite initiated by user

## Next Steps (Post-Session)
1. **Analyze test results** when current run completes
2. **Categorize failure modes** systematically
3. **Identify algorithm improvement opportunities** based on failure patterns
4. **Implement targeted improvements** to handle challenging cases
5. **Re-test with improved algorithms** for iterative development

## Session Statistics
- **Duration:** ~2 hours
- **Models Added:** 13 complex models
- **Lines Added:** ~1000+ lines of model implementation code
- **Test Cases Added:** 13 individual model tests
- **Total Models in Framework:** 30+ across 5 categories

## Scientific Value
This session establishes a comprehensive stress-test suite for the parameter estimation algorithm, enabling data-driven algorithm improvement through systematic failure analysis. The challenging models represent real-world complexity that the algorithm must handle for practical applicability.
